## Skills

The following plan is proposed by Six and we all agree it will be very helpful.

For everyone:
Read "The hard way is easier" by Zed Shaw. This is a short piece. It explains how to use a book to learn programming. The piece is not dense, but if necessary, the native English speakers in the team should support the non-native English speakers in grasping the full practical meaning of the piece.
Each person in the HTML5 Canvas/JavaScript group should:
Work through Chapters 1–5 and 8 up to p. 483 only (stop at "Rock Object Prototype", after you have built "Geo Blaster Basic") of the second edition ofHTML5 Canvas by Steve and Jeff Fulton. (That link points to the full PDF.) In Chapter 1, skip the first 2 pages. Start reading at page 3, under the heading "The Basic HTML5 Page".
Follow Zed Shaw's instructions while doing this:
Type in every example exactly (no copy-paste) and make it run.
If you don't understand something the author has written, just keep going. If you are curious about it, feel free to google it and spend a few minutes reading about it. For example, on page 3 there is a paragraph about "<!doctype html>". It has some interesting historical details about why things are the way they are. Some day you may be interested in this. But for now, it probably won't make sense, and that's fine. The most important thing for you to do while working through this book is to type in the examples and make them work. There is a lot of background information (about web standards, etc.). It may be interesting, but it is not relevant to you right now. Anything that is code, type it in and make it work. Anything else, especially if it seems like background, read it once or twice, and if you don't get it, move on.
Keep a paper journal on your process and thoughts while doing this. For example, if you are stuck on something, take a minute to journal something like "Stuck on X. I am trying to do it by [explain]. Maybe it is not working because [ideas about why]. Frustrated [or other feeling associated with this part of the process]." When you finish a chapter in the book or overcome a major challenge, take a minute to journal about it. I will not look at the journal, so be completely honest with yourself in it. ("WTF", "WTF Six", or just "AUGGGGHHHHHHH" are legitimate entries.) This may even help you spot errors faster and persist in the work rather than giving up.
By the time you are done with these five and a half chapters, you will have:
A working JavaScript development environment and workflow (you will have this by the end of Chapter 1).
A deep working knowledge of HTML5 Canvas programming with JavaScript, including use of the Box2D engine.
A collection of working exercises in HTML files (e.g., CH1EX1.html, CH5EX7.html, etc.).
A working game, Geo Blaster Basic, that runs in your browser.
Prepare a 25-minute presentation of the game you have written (Geo Blaster Basic) and of your experience learning how to program JavaScript in the HTML5 Canvas. It should have three parts:
Live demo.
Walk through playing a game and all of the other features the application has. Explain roughly what is happening in the code.
This demo should take about 10 minutes.
You should write a script, in complete sentences, of exactly what you are going to show and what you are going to say while you show it. You may (should) read from the script.
Code walkthrough.
After the demo, switch to your development environment and walk through the code. Start with the main function and explain its contents. When code in another function is called, say so and move to that function. Explain what happens when that code is called. Explain why the program is organized the way it is.
This should also take about 10 minutes.
You should also write a script for this part.
Reflection.
Based on the notes in your journal, describe your process. Where did you get stuck? How did you overcome those obstacles? What was the process like mentally? What was easy? How did you feel about the whole process at the end? How does this compare to how you felt at the beginning? etc.
This should be about 5 minutes and should also be scripted. Go over your journal notes and think seriously about your process, then prepare your script.


Each person in the HTML, CSS, WordPress, and layout/visual design group should do the following. This may seem like more work than the work assigned to the first group. This group is developing a broader set of skills, so there may be more pages to read. But the books assigned to this group are "lighter" than the book assigned to the first group. The workload is roughly even. And, most importantly, the skills being developed by each group will complement each other.
Work through Chapters 1–11 of Head First HTML and CSS.
Follow Zed Shaw's instructions while doing this: type in every example exactly (no copy-paste) and make it run. You can do the pencil and paper exercises in this book if you like, or you can just focus on making the code examples run.
Keep a paper journal on your process and thoughts while doing this. For example, if you are stuck on something, take a minute to journal something like "Stuck on X. I am trying to do it by [explain]. Maybe it is not working because [ideas about why]. Frustrated [or other feeling associated with this part of the process]." When you finish a chapter in the book or overcome a major challenge, take a minute to journal about it. I will not look at the journal, so be completely honest with yourself in it. ("WTF" or even "WTF Six" are legitimate entries.) This may even help you spot errors faster and persist in the work rather than giving up.
By the time you are done with these 11 chapters, you will have:
A working HTML and CSS development environment and workflow.
A deep working knowledge of HTML and CSS.
A collection of increasingly sophisticated working web pages (HTML, CSS, and image files).
Work through Chapters 1–7 of Smashing WordPress Themes. Follow Zed Shaw's instructions and keep a paper journal, like you did with Head First HTML and CSS. By the time you are done, you will have a deep working knowledge of WordPress and you will have built your own theme from scratch.
Read Chapters 1–9 of White Space Is Not Your Enemy.
Skim Thinking With Type.
Prepare a 25-minute presentation of what you have built and learned. It should have four parts:
HTML and CSS.
Show the most sophisticated page you built while working through Head First HTML and CSS and explain both the HTML and CSS.
This should take about 5 minutes.
You should write a script, in complete sentences, of exactly what you are going to show and what you are going to say while you show it. You may (should) read from the script.
WordPress theme demo.
Give a live demo of the theme you built in Chapter 7 of Smashing WordPress Themes. Walk through the different parts of the code (e.g., PHP and CSS files) and explain how they work together. To the extent you need to, explain how WordPress and WordPress themes work in general.
This should take about 10 minutes and should also be scripted.
Visual design.
Summarize the key lessons you learned from White Space Is Not Your Enemy.
If you saw anything you liked in Thinking With Type, share it.
This section should be about 5 minutes and should also be scripted.
Reflection.
Based on the notes in your journal, describe your process. Where did you get stuck? How did you overcome those obstacles? What was the process like mentally? What was easy? How did you feel about the whole process at the end? How does this compare to how you felt at the beginning? etc.
This should be about 5 minutes and should also be scripted. Go over your journal notes and think seriously about your process, then prepare your script.



# Timeline

## For JavaScript/HTML 5 Canvas
Spend the first three 3-week periods on part 1. Spend the last 3-week period on part 2 (preparing the presentation). If you are not able to work for part of the summer, adjust your schedule accordingly.

## For HTML/CSS/Wordpress/Design

You should spend the first 3–week period on Head First HTML and CSS. You should spend the second and third 3–week period (the middle six weeks of the summer) on Smashing WordPress Themes. In the last 3–week period, spend the first week reading White Space Is Not Your Enemy and Thinking With Type and the last two weeks preparing your presentation. If you are not able to work for part of the summer, adjust your schedule accordingly.

Presentations will take place in the first or second week of fall quarter. I will plan to attend. I will invite Prof. Ziv, the new TA, and Evelyn. We will schedule the presentations by email in early September.
