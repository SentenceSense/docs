## What we are building

We are creating a new website for Sentence Sense.  The new website will draw from the old website’s Part One.  The new website will revise content from the old website and reorganize and compress content from the original site.  

Sentence Sense is an interactive online learning experience.  The website will have interactive learning exercises for the students.  The results of these exercises will be able to be tracked and analyzed by instructors or tutors.  At the end of each chapter, there will be a Review and Practice section that will test the user and link them to the sections corresponding to the incorrect answers.  The results from this test will also be able to be tracked by an instructor or tutor.

The site’s text and displays will be designed for screens 4 x 6 inches or larger. The site will also allow for expansion to include later chapters.  The new website will be launched on a server that can support and pilot it while the remaining parts are being built.

Because the website will be used by students ages twelve and up, it is important to design a lean, intuitive and easily navigable website.

## Why we are building it

This website will satisfy the need for an online resource, not found on any other similar website, that teaches “how a sentence works.” Other websites do well to teach prescriptive grammar (how to fix errors) but there are none that focus on how sentences work (descriptive grammar). This website will hope to be the resource which provides this missing information by providing interactive lessons with games and visualizations.

There will be various types of users who will be able to utilize this website including students in college, high school, home school programs, as well as adults and independent learners. The website will cater to users age 12 and up who are able to read English at an 8th grade level. Due to this wide audience the website will need to not only be appealing to all these different types of users, but also still teach them valuable lessons that are applicable to each individual’s personal life and situations for which they are using this resource in the first place.
