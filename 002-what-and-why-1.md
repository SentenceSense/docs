## What we are building

We are building a "squirrel". The squirrel will be a small, omnivorous, mostly tree-dwelling mammal. It will be 10 inches long, with an 8-inch tail. It will be covered in short gray-brown fur. The tail will be very bushy. The squirrel will have big black eyes and little rounded ears that stick up. It will walk on four feet. It will be able to climb up and down trees with ease. It will eat mostly seeds and nuts, but it will be able to eat all kinds of plant matter. It will also be able to eat insects, bird eggs, small birds, and M&Ms when plant matter is hard to find. As a result, it will thrive in cities.

It will be eaten by humans, birds of prey, larger carnivorous and omnivorous mammals such as raccoons and cats, and snakes. In human cooking, its meat will be an acceptable substitute for chicken but be slightly "gamey".

Because it will eat mostly seeds and nuts, it will play an important role in distributing the seeds of trees.

## Why we are building it

The squirrel addresses un- or under-met needs of three stakeholder groups: trees, medium-sized carnivores and omnivores in cities, and humans in cities.

The squirrel meets an unmet seed distribution need for trees. There are currently two main classes of distributors of tree seeds: herbivorous birds and large mammals such as beavers and bears. Birds can move seeds large distances, but tend to be small and only eat a few seeds. Additionally, some seeds need to be distributed locally; far-ranging birds distribute seeds sparsely over a large area, rather than densely throughout the local area. Large mammals distribute seeds well locally, but prefer other food sources such as fish and fruit, and eat seeds only when their preferred food is scarce. In contrast, the squirrel is a seed and nut specialist. It travels extensively for a ground animal, but does not fly, addressing the need for denser local seed distribution.

The squirrel meets an unmet food need for medium-sized urban carnivores and omnivores. Most medium-sized urban carnivores and omnivores feed mainly on discarded human food. Discarded human food poses three kinds of health risks to urban carnivores and omnivores. First, it may be toxic. Second, it may be mixed with dangerous non-food items such as plastics or metals. Third, it is easy to get, so urban carnivores and omnivores may live sedentary lifestyles. A small, nimble seed and nut specialist offers a high-quality food source and a great reason to stay active.

The squirrel offers urban humans two kinds of benefits. First, as for non-human urban omnivores, it is a potentially high-quality, low-cost food source. Crucially, the squirrel will be small and has a low meat content compared to typical human meat sources such as chicken, pigs, and cattle. Squirrels are therefore unlikely to be produced in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), which would put its health and cost advantages as a human food source at risk. Second, the squirrel will be adorable, offering aesthetic benefits and hours of entertainment for humans. This will improve quality of life and boost tourism revenues.
