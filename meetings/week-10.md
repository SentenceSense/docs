##Did you show your sponsor your deployed minimum viable product? What did they say? What were they happy about? What feedback did they give you?

Yes, we showed Evelyn our MVP and she really liked it overall, but still had a few things she wanted to see changed before our final demo. Some of these things weere getting rid of the white margin space, adding content for sections 1.1 and 1.2, and modifying some of the old content. 

##Did you talk about what needs to be done next, in general? What did you decide?

In terms of things that needed to be done for our final demo, she gave us a list of some minor tweaks that she wanted to be seen and continued to give us a few more via email up until the day before the demo. We had decided at our last meeting that we would get the site to a good MVP standard for our final demo based on feedback she would give us right up until the day before which is exactly what we did by doing all that she asked of us. 

##Did you talk about what needs to be done over the summer? What did you decide? What is your timeline for doing this work? Who will do it?

As far as for the summer and next 2 quarters, we decided we would still be maintaining the website, adding content and making any necessary changes while also learning how to create interactive games using JavaScript. Over the summer we will have to learn JavaScript and how ot integrate it with the HTML5 canvas. Some of us will also have to focus on maintaining and updating the site so they will need to learn more about HTML and CSS along with how it works with WordPress.
