## Communication schedule

We will meet Kayla and Jeff in person every Monday at Sqrls-R-Us at 12 PM.

We will also email them a report of what we have done in the last week, with relevant links to changes on the working application, every Sunday by 8 PM.

## Project goals

Our goal this quarter is to produce a working, live, "minimum viable" version of SimSquirrel. It should be deployed on a subdomain of Sqrls-R-Us's current website, simsquirrel.sqrlsrus.com.

## Other notes

Kayla will be out of town May 5 and May 12. We will meet with Jeff on those days. We will also email Kayla on the preceding Sundays as normal.

Kayla will give us login information to the server that hosts sqrlsrus.com at our next meeting.
