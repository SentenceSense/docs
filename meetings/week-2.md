## Communication schedule

We will have our meeting every Wednesday at 12PM PST through Google Hangouts or Skype.

We will email the sponsor with any changes and progress we have made on a weekly basis.


## Project goals

Our goal this quarter is to update the new website (http://sentencesyntax.com/) into a live, functional website that incorporates the material from the old website (http://www.ccc.commnet.edu/sensen/) 

## Other notes

Evelyn does not reside in the state so our main channel of communication is through email and video conferencing.

She mentioned her relative, Herschel, can be a liaison for her.
