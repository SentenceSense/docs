In the meetings directory in your team’s docs repository, make a file called week-8-9.md. It should answer these questions:
     Who was there?
     Where was it?
     When was it?
     Did you show your sponsor your progress? What did you show? What did they say?
     Did you talk about what needs to be done between now and the end of the quarter (i.e., to deliver your minimum viable product)? What did you decide?
If you have any other issues you want to tell us about, please add them in an appropriately named section.

##Did you show your sponsor your progress? What did you show? What did they say?

We showed Evelyn the new format and layout of the homepage. The homepage has the “try this” icon, but it’s still under experiment stage. We also make the text and format simpler and cleaner. Every stuffs are changed based on Evelyn’s feedback. The navigation bar was also the biggest change. Evelyn didn’t want the drop down menu to fill out the whole page. We want to avoid any unnecessary empty space on the margin and delete any unnecessary segments. We also changed the “pencil” icon much fitting to Evelyn’s wants. Evelyn did like the “pencil” icon. 

##Did you talk about what needs to be done between now and the end of the quarter (i.e., to deliver your minimum viable product)? What did you decide?

We still had a really hard time on with the finer points of the navigation bar. Evelyn did mention many ideas and gave us feedback for the colors and sizes. We will change the navigation bar to fit what our sponsor wants. Evelyn wants the color of the tabs to match the style of the text. There is plenty of unnecessary spaces between the segments. Basically, the navigation bar needs to be simple enough. Another thing that we want to finish is that, we like to add “next” and “back” buttons at the bottom of each page. If possible, we also want to add some content to the pages instead of just dummy text.
