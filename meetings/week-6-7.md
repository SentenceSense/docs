## Did you show your sponsor your progress? What did you show? What did they say?

We showed Evelyn the WordPress website that we made, which contained a homepage, chapters and sections. The homepage also had a banner picture along with the description from the old website. The background was greyed out, which she liked. It also contained a navigation bar, which she didn’t like so much. We put all the chapters and sections that were on the old website, however, Evelyn said that we only needed to have first seven chapters’ content. She did tell us that the website need to be simple as possible. We basically didn’t add any complicated or distracting features and pictures to the website. Evelyn liked the website so far and provided some feedback and suggestions.


##Did you talk about what needs to be done next? What did you decide?

Evelyn wanted a new custom designed logo for the website as a banner. We basically decided that the logo should be designed with the old one in mind. We created several different designs for Evelyn to pick from and are still communicating back-and-forth about how to improve it. We also need to add content to the website as she provided it because we weren’t using the old website’s content anymore like we initially thought. We added links to their respective empty pages for later development. Later in the week, we basically messed around with the stylesheet to figure out how to manage the text, color, and fonts that can fit to the pages’ design depending on what Evelyn prefers.
