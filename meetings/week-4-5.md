## Did you talk about your software design (e.g., language[s], framework[s], features)? What did you decide together? Did you make changes to your software design document?

We made a big change from our previous plan which was to create a custom CMS using Ruby on Rails. In this meeting we discussed some other possibilities and decided that a better option would be to customize a WordPress theme. This would save us the time of having to build up an entire website from scratch and instead allow us more time to focus on creating the interactive applications that our client has more of an interest in. Since we are focusing on a WordPress website we will need to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP.

## Did you talk about your skills assessments and learning plans? Does your client understand the skills of each team member, what skills the project requires, and what each team member is doing to learn what is needed to deliver the project? Did they have anything to say about this? Did you make changes to your learning plan?

We let our client know that we, as a team, are not as skilled as she might think but that we would try our best to learn all the necessary skills needed to complete this project to her satisfaction. We found some resources such as books and tutorials we could use to learn the new tools we’d need, taking into account that we no longer would be using Ruby on Rails. We will now use JavaScript: The Definitive Guide 6th Edition to learn JavaScript, since that’s what he majority of our project will focus on, and learn PHP, jQuery, CSS, and HTML using tutorials.
