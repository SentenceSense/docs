#Elevator Pitch

If you've ever found yourself confused about how to structure a sentence or are just curious about what makes up our everyday language or if you ever get stuck when you're trying to put together a sentence, this is where you should go. Sentence Sense is an online grammar course and textbook that helps students become stronger and more confident writers. This is done through various learning exercises that teach the user about sentences and their structure. 

Our group is redesigning the online grammar course to create a great user experience for both the teacher and the students. The old website is dated and lacks many new features to draw in the students and keep them interested. Part of the redesign is creating a content management system that will allow someone without a technical background to easily update content on their own. The second part of the redesign is to create interactive features and a site that will interest the user and help them learn. This will hopefully lead to a better experience for both students and administrators alike.
