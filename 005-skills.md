We will need to know how to use Ruby on Rails
We will need to know how to use a Rails framework using Ruby
We may need to know how to develop a website on Blue Host
We may need to know to code in JavaScript to build interactive modules

4.To contribute fully to the project, what do you need to learn?
Depending on which path the team chooses, I will need to learn Ruby on Rails.  I may also need to learn how to create a more complex WordPress.  Later in the project, I may also need to learn Java in order to create interactive modules.
